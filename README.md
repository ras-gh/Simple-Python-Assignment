# Simple-Python-Assignment
On 6/2/24 we were given a simple assignment to create a program in Python which would
create admission tickets for entry to a Theme Park
The program first displays the ticket prices, then asks the user to input
how many adult, child and senior tickets are required.
The program also asks the user if a parking permit is required.
Finally, the admission ticket is printed showing admission details
and the date of purchase printed on the ticket. A parking permit is also
printed if it was requested.
